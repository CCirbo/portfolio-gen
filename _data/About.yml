      My journey into software development began with an insatiable curiosity—always wanting to understand how things work and how to make them better.

      For 14 years, I thrived in a non-tech career, wearing many hats and tackling diverse challenges. Whether streamlining processes, managing projects, or improving systems with careful attention to detail, I honed skills like adaptability, communication, and a focus on efficiency—traits I now bring to building thoughtful, user-centered applications.

      I work well in collaborative environments where I can turn ideas into impactful tools that make a difference. Currently, I’m refining my skills in full-stack development using Ruby on Rails, React with TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
      
      My goal is to create technology that’s not only functional but also meaningful—tools that connect, empower, and simplify.
