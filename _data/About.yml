      Growing up in a small town with limited resources, my local library was my sanctuary—a place where I discovered the power of free information and a lifelong love of learning. That curiosity and drive to solve problems shape who I am today as a software developer.

      For 14 years, I thrived in a non-tech career where I wore many hats and tackled diverse challenges. Whether streamlining processes, managing projects, or improving systems, I honed skills like adaptability, communication, and a focus on efficiency—traits I now bring to building thoughtful, user-centered applications.

      Software development felt like a natural fit for my passion for problem-solving and creating meaningful solutions. I approach every project with curiosity, attention to detail, and empathy, aiming to craft tools that connect people, simplify lives, and make a positive impact.
