      My journey into software development began with an insatiable curiosity—always wanting to understand how things work and how to make them better.

      After 14 years of managing payroll, financial operations, and streamlining processes in the HVAC/Engineering industry, I transitioned into software development to combine my problem-solving skills with my passion for building impactful tools.

      Through my training at Turing School of Software & Design, I’ve been developing hands-on experience in full-stack development using Ruby on Rails, React, and Tailwind CSS. I’ve designed accessible and responsive user interfaces, created dynamic applications leveraging external APIs, and built robust backend systems that optimize workflows.
      
      My diverse background equips me with a unique perspective: I approach technical challenges with both strategic thinking and a commitment to crafting user-centered solutions. I’m passionate about designing technology that empowers users, simplifies processes, and delivers meaningful results.
